\begin{problem}
    Solve each of the following systems of equations using the backslash ($\setminus$) operator, and the \emph{rref} command.  Reconcile the seeming differences.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
        \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
      3x &- &y&+&4z&= &2 \\
	 &&y&+&z&=&1\\
     -2x&&&+&3z&=&1
    \end{array}
    \end{equation}
  
    
    What is true about this system?
    
    \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice[correct]{The system is consistent.  Using the backslash operator produces the same result as using the \emph{rref} function.}
    \choice{The system is inconsistent.  The backslash operator gives the least squares approximation.}
    \choice{The system is consistent but has infinitely many solutions.  The backslash operator gives one of those solutions.}
    \end{multipleChoice}

       \item 
    \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
      3x &- &y&+&4z&= &2 \\
	 x&-&y&+&2z&=&4\\
     -2x&+&y&-&3z&=&-3
    \end{array}
    \end{equation}

    What is true about this system?
    \begin{multipleChoice}
    \choice{The system is consistent.  Using the backslash operator produces the same result as using the \emph{rref} function.}
    \choice{The system is inconsistent.  The backslash operator gives the least squares approximation.}
    \choice[correct]{The system is consistent but has infinitely many solutions.  The backslash operator gives one particular solution.}
    \end{multipleChoice}

    \item 
    \begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
      3x &- &y&+&4z&= &2 \\
	 x&-&y&+&2z&=&1\\
     -2x&+&y&-&3z&=&1
