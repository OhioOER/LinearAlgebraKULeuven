\section*{Gershgorin's Theorem}
We have seen that eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial, and therefore may be complex numbers, even when a matrix has entries that are real.  This section is devoted to a remarkable theorem proved in 1931 called Gersgorin's theorem, which says that the $n$ eigenvalues of an $n \times n$ matrix can be found in a region in the complex plane consisting of $n$ disks.  We explore the theorem for the case $n=3$ before proving the result.
