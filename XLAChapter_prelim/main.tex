\section*{Learning Outcomes}
After completing this chapter, students should be able to do the following.
 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Perform basic operations, including addition, scalar multiplication and dot product on vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
    \item Perform basic operations, including addition and scalar multiplication, on geometric representations of vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
    \item Transition seamlessly between algebraic and geometric representations of vectors in $\RR^n$.
    
   \item  Determine the angle between vectors and test for orthogonality.
   
 \end{itemize}
