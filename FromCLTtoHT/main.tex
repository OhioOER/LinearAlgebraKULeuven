\begin{example}\label{ex:cheesecake}
A restaurant claims that their cheesecake dessert contains 400 calories with a known population standard deviation of 25 calories. After an inspection, a food critic has suspected that the desert contains more calories than the restaurant claims and decided to take a sample of 100 cheesecakes to test their claim. The critic finds out that the sample mean is 410 calories. Answer the questions below:

\begin{question} 
Please identify the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mu$ (presumed population mean) $= \answer{400}$
    \item $\sigma$ (population standard deviation) $= \answer{25}$
    \item $\bar{x}$ (sample mean) $=\answer{410}$
    \item $n$ (sample size) $= \answer{100}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question} Select the correct formula for calculating standard deviation for a sampling distribution.

\begin{multipleChoice}  
    \choice{$\sigma_{\bar{x}} = \sigma(n+1)/\sqrt{n}$}  
    \choice[correct]{$\sigma_{\bar{x}} =\sigma/\sqrt{n}$}  
    \choice{$\sigma  = \sigma_{\bar{x}} /\sqrt{n}$}  
    \choice{$\sigma = \frac{b-a}{\sqrt{12}}$}  
\end{multipleChoice} 

\end{question}

\begin{question} Using the correct formula please determine the value of standard deviation for the sampling distribution:
$$\mbox{St. dev. for sampling distribution:}\quad\sigma_{\bar{x}}= \answer{2.5}$$
\end{question}

\begin{question} Please pick the correct graph that represents the sampling distribution assuming that the mean is 400 calories [MAYBE MAKE A VIDEO HERE ON HOW TO MAKE THE GRAPH]
\end{question}

\begin{question}
How likely is a sample of 410 calories to occur?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Likely}
\choice{Somewhat likely}
\choice[correct]{Unlikely}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

\end{example}

\begin{example}
A potato chips company claims that on average their package contains 200 grams of potato chips. Based on the many years of testing, it is known that the population standard deviation is 10 grams and the amounts are normally distributed. Suppose that the company headquarters suspects that the manufacturer is routinely under-filling the packs of chips to cut the production cost. The company headquarters sends an inspector to the plant to find out what’s going on. The inspector picks up 25 random bags of potato chips from conveyor and finds out that the average weight of bags is 195 grams.

\begin{example}
Suppose a company manufactures snack bars. The company claims that the average wight of their granola bar is 130 grams and it's known that the population standard deviation is 6. After a routine check a mechanic stated that the machine might be broken and the weight of the granola bar is definitely not 130 grams. The company decided to test mechanics claim and took a random sample of 36 granola bars. The average weight turned out to be 133 grams.

\begin{question}
Please determine the value of standard deviation for the sampling distribution:
$$\mbox{St. dev. for sampling distribution:}\quad\sigma_{\bar{x}}= \answer{1}$$

\choice[correct]{129 - 131 grams}
\choice{128 - 132 grams}
\choice{127 - 133 grams}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
How many standard deviations away from the mean is considered "highly unlikely"?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{1 std}
\choice{2 std}
\choice[correct]{3 std}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

\begin{question}

\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Likely}
\choice{Somewhat likely}
\choice[correct]{Unlikely}
\end{multipleChoice}
\end{question}

Sample question.  What is the answer?
$$\text{Solution: }\answer{4}$$

\end{example}


\begin{example}
Farmer Joe is looking to sell his farm along with animals. Emily is interested in buying the farm. To make the offer sound more appealing, Farmer Joe states that his chicken on average lay 10 eggs per week (with a std of 1), while the national average is only 6 eggs per week. Emily wants to test Joe’s claim and decides to see herself how many eggs Joe's chickens will produce in 1 week. Among 9 Joe's chickens, the average number of eggs per week turned out to be 9.5 . 

\begin{question}
Please identify the following:
[I AM CONFUSED MYSELF HERE TO BE HONEST]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\mu$ (presumed population mean) $= \answer{6}$
    \item $\sigma$ (population standard deviation) $= \answer{1}$
    \item $\bar{x}$ (sample mean) $=\answer{9.5}$
    \item $n$ (sample size) $= \answer{9}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
How likely is that the Farmer Joe tells the truth about his chickens?
\begin{multipleChoice}
\choice{Likely}
\choice[correct]{Somewhat likely}
\choice{Unlikely}
\end{multipleChoice}
