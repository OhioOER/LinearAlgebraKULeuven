We know that two points determine a line.  Do you know how many points determine a parabola?  What about a cubic?  To address these questions we will start with an alternative way of finding an equation of a line.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:curveFitLine}
Consider two points $A(-3, 2)$ and $B(1,-2)$.  We will find a function $f$ whose graph is a line that passes through these points.  We know that $f(x)=ax+b$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.  Because the graph of $f$ passes through $A$ and $B$, we must have the following:
$$\begin{matrix}
      f(-3)&=&a(-3)&+&b&=&2\\
      f(1)&=&a(1)&+&b&=&-2
    \end{matrix}$$
To solve for $a$ and $b$, we need to solve the following matrix equation:
$$\begin{bmatrix}\answer{-3} & \answer{1}\\\answer{1} & \answer{1}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\answer{2}\\\answer{-2}\end{bmatrix}$$
Solving the equation, we find that $a=-1$ and $b=-1$.  This gives us:
$$f(x)=-x-1$$

The GeoGebra interactive below shows two points $A$ and $B$, together with the matrix equation that produces function coefficients for the function whose graph passes through $A$ and $B$.  Drag the points around the plane to see how the matrix equation changes.

From a purely formal standpoint, we observe that the matrix equation has the form:
$$\begin{bmatrix}x\text{-coordinate} & 1\\x\text{-coordinate} & 1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}a\\b\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}y\text{-coordinate}\\y\text{-coordinate}\end{bmatrix}$$
where each row corresponds to one point.
\end{exploration}

Now we are ready to move to quadratic, and higher degree polynomial functions.

Linear function in Exploration \ref{exp:curveFitLine} had two unknown coefficients that we needed to find in order to determine the function. Two points gave us a system of two equations and two unknowns.

A quadratic polynomial function, whose graph is a parabola, has the form:
$$f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$$
Three unknown coefficients will require three points to determine them.

\begin{exploration}\label{exp:curveFitParabola}
We will find a quadratic function of the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ whose graph passes through $A(-2,2)$, $B(0, -1)$ and $C(1, 5)$.
To do this, we need to find coefficients $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that
$$\begin{matrix}f(-2)&=&a(-2)^2&+&b(-2)&+&c&=&2\\f(0)&=&a(0)^2&+&b(0)&+&c&=&-1\\f(1)&=&a(1)^2&+&b(1)&+&c&=&5\end{matrix}$$

The following GeoGebra interactive shows points $A$, $B$, and $C$, together with the matrix equation, and its solution.

Drag the points around the plane to observe changes in the coefficient matrix.  Think geometrically to find locations of $A$, $B$ and $C$ such that
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a=b=0$; $c\neq 0$.
    \item $a=0$; $b, c\neq 0$.
\end{itemize}
\end{exploration}

\section*{Practice Problems}
\begin{problem}\label{prob:systemProblems}
Two GeoGebra screenshots are shown below:
    \begin{image}
         \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{pointsCoincide.jpg}\quad
         \includegraphics[height=1.5in]{verticalPoints.jpg}
\end{image}
In the first screenshot, points $A$ and $B$ coincide.  In the second screenshot, point $A$ is located directly above point $B$. 
In both cases, GeoGebra failed to produce a linear function whose graph passes through $A$ and $B$.

Based on what you know about functions and geometry, explain why the process fails for these two examples. How do your observations correspond to what happens from an algebraic standpoint?
