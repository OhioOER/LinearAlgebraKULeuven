    \item Determine whether sets are closed under addition and/or scalar multiplication.
    \item Determine whether a set of vectors is a basis of a subspace or $\RR^n$.
    \item Write the coordinates of a vector for a given basis of $\RR^n$.
    \item Identify the dimension of the span of a given set of vectors.   
    \item Compute the row space, column space, and null space of a given matrix.
